# FakeAPBuilder - A User-Friendly Interface for mdk4 

![HEADER_IMAGE](src/mitm.png)

This tool, called FakeAPBuilder, builds upon the functionality of the mdk4 tool, which enables users to create fake access points (APs) and carry out Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. The FakeAPBuilder script acts as a user-friendly interface for the mdk4 tool by automating several steps in the process.

First, the script checks whether mdk4 is installed. If it is not, it installs the tool. Next, it verifies whether packet injection is working on the user's interface. If it is not, the script will terminate.

Assuming the packet injection is functioning, the user is prompted to select the desired interface for creating the fake AP. Once selected, the script leverages the information in the file.lst file to create the fake AP, which includes both the SSID and the password of the fake AP.

If the user desires to modify the SSID or password, they can simply edit the file.lst file prior to running the script. Once the fake AP has been created, the MITM attack can commence. Overall, the FakeAPBuilder tool provides an accessible means for users to create fake APs and carry out MITM attacks using the mdk4 tool.

## Prerequisites
- Run the script with root privileges only (sudo).
- Install the following dependencies:
  - mdk4 (automatically installed by the script)
  - Aircrack-ng
  - Python3
- Make sure that your wireless card supports packet injection and monitor mode. 

## Usage
- `git clone https://github.com/karthik558/FakeAPBuilder && cd FakeAPBuilder`
- `sudo python3 FakeAPBuilder.py`
- `sudo python3 FakeAPBuilder.py -h` for help. 
- `python3 random__string__generator.py` to generate random strings for SSID for MITM attack (automatically generated by the script and stored in random___string.lst).
